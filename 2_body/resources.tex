To execute the methods in this proposal, an OpenVR compatible virtual reality headset is required that is capable of built head tracking to demonstrate surgical intervention with a minimal setup consisting of only desktop machine, substitute surgical instruments and headset that does not intervene with the space limitations of a standard operating theatre.

Slicer and SlicerVirtualReality are distributed under a BSD styled license and the contributing work will be licensed under the same or compatible license.

Human ethics approval is only required to perform testing and verification of the simulated physics model accuracy with stakeholder patient data. Development and testing throughout the project for areas such as physics simulation and tools testing can be performed with sample and primitive soft body data. Patient data requiring ethics approval will be shared via CloudStor and will only be available to research designated systems.

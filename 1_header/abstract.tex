Surgical simulation is an area of computational biomechanics with the potential to provide valuable intervention training and planning resources to modern medicine. With the aid of meshless total Lagrangian explicit dynamics (MTLED), it is possible to perform real-time surgical simulation utilizing virtual soft body materials constructed from patient data within an acceptable degree of accuracy for human interaction. Creation of useful surgical simulation software in conjunction with material simulation requires efficient methods of human interfacing to perform pre-processing, planning, simulated operation, and post-processing of simulated materials. This proposal will discuss new approaches for preparing collected 3D data via a virtual reality human interface device to provide accurate simulation and easy to interpret planning and testing techniques for surgical interventions.

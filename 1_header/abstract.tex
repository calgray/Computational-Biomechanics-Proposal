Meshless algorithms consist of techniques for processing 3D volume material dynamics using approaches with high accuracy than finite element methods. In the area surgical intervention, simulating biological material dynamics with this approach can provide more accurate and easier to interpret planning and testing techniques for intervention with the assistance of processes for preparing patient data to be suitable for dynamics simulation. This paper will discuss techniques for processing CT and MRI data in conjunction with 3D surface construction suitable for surgical intervention simulation of soft bodies.
